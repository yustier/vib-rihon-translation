  - title: "[Preface]"
    contents:
      - This book is, to put it bluntly, a 'Vibriographic dictionary'.
      - The 'Vibriography' and its explanations in this book are my own brainstorming 'interpretations' of words that Vibri used frequently and which were difficult for me to understand when I was having fun talking with her on a daily basis.
      - Of course, each person's 'interpretation of Vibriography' will vary from person to person. This book is not intended to push any personal 'interpretation' onto you, the reader. We would be happy if you could 'interpret' the 'Vibriography' in your own way by looking at Vibri-chan in front of you and listening to her words.
      - I only wanted to create a kick-start, so to speak, for readers to make these 'interpretations'.
      - Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Komatsu-kun, Tate-chan and Yan-san, who are authorities on 'Vibriographic interpretation' and who have contributed to the production of this book.
      - Well, have a nice 'interpretation' to you all!
      - Koyuru Ebisu, Visiting Professor at Wellow Kaythen University (E-koyuru@nanaon-sha.com)
  - title: "[How to enjoy flick book]"
    contents:
      - This book can not only be used as a 'Vibriographic dictionary', but also as the world's first '3D flick book'. Please read the following instructions carefully and enjoy.
      - (1) Detach the 3D glasses.
      - |
        First of all, remove the 3D glasses at the very back of this book.
        Please do so carefully along the perforations to avoid tearing them in the heat of the moment.
      - (2) Make the rims of the glasses.
      - |
        Once the glasses have been removed, use an awl or similar tool to drill holes in the white dots on the left and right edges.
        It is very dangerous, so young children should have their mothers or others do it for them.
        Once the holes have been punched, make an earpiece by threading a rubber band or string through it.
      - (3) Wear the glasses.
      - |
        Once the earpiece is in place, the glasses are ready to wear. Put them on so that the blue lens is on your right eye.
        If you find it troublesome to make glasses, you can hold them by hand as they are.
      - (4) Flick the book.
      - |
        This book has a flick book at the top and bottom of the page.
        Turn the pages at once and enjoy.
      - Notes
      - Do not wear the glasses for long periods of time.
      - It is very dangerous to walk around with 3D glasses on. Never do this.
